# üîç Problem 1: Find Most Frequent Element
# Given a list of integers, return the value that appears most frequently.
# If there's a tie, return any of the most frequent.
#
# Example:
# Input: [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3]
# Output: 3


def most_frequent(numbers):
    # Your code here
    return max(set(numbers), key=numbers.count)
Numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3]
print(most_frequent(Numbers))

Time and Space Analysis for problem 1:
- Best-case: 2
- Worst-case: 5 
- Average-case: 2
- Space complexity: 7

- Why this approach?
The reason this approach is beneficial since it can find what's the most frequent number that is shown
on the lists. 
- Could it be optimized?
Yes, it can be optimized but it'll require some additional coding in order for the function to be 
optimized.

Yes, It's possible.

# Create a function that adds n elements to a list that has a fixed initial capacity.

Time and Space Analysis for problem 4:
- When do resizes happen?
Resize can happen if the list is too much.
- What is the worst-case for a single append?

- What is the amortized time per append overall?

- Why does doubling reduce the cost overall?
